# An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
# A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
# A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the contents of the pouch.
# Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
